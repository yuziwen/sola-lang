#+TITLE: the Sola Programming Language
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

This is my own programming language called sola
which I have just begun to work on.

It is a Lisp-like language but aims at exploring new features,
also, maybe, educational purposes.

Actually I just want to find somethings to do
in the boring high school :p\\
Enjoy yourself!
